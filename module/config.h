/*

 *
 * Provides utilities to permit persistent storage and retrieval of BMS configuration
 * settings, using the onboard EEPROM storage. This should include all constants
 * that can vary in the code, and that can be changed at runtime.
 * Examples include fault thresholds, timeouts, cell populations, etc. In addition,
 * a set of default configurations should be defined at compile time, to be
 * used whenever necessary, and at the discretion of the caller.
