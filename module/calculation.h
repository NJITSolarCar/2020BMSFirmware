 * calculation.h
 *
 * Defines the floating point calculations that the BMS must perform
 * at a high level. Examples include State of charge, real current, real voltage, etc.
 * Also included are methods to perform high level checks of voltages, currents,
 * charge, etc. Note: these methods should be completely independent from any hardware
 * access!
