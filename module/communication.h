/*
 * communication.h
 *
 * Provides a high level interface for generic communication between the mcu and
 * outside world, primarily over CAN, RS485, and optionally UART. With this interface,
 * it becomes possible to abstract the specific communication protocol and
 * instead provide a broad set of functions that the main application can use
 * to communicate with the outside world and vice versa.
