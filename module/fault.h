 * Manages all fault handling of the system. This should provide a set of
 * functions to detect and respond to faults based on input data passed to
 * the functions. When faults are detected, the appropriate flags should be
 * set, outputs updated, messages sent, etc. This includes running fault
 * status LEDs, etc.
