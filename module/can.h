 * Provides a driver for CAN communications using the CAN interface in
 * the mcu, along with the TCAN1042H transceiver chip. This should provide
 * basic HAL, initialization, and messaging features, but should not
 * worry about implementing the formal solar car CAN protocol, which will be
 * implemented externally.
